# RetroDRY-ServerTemplate

This is a starting point for the C# .NET Core server for RetroDRY.

This template has been compiled with RetryDRY version 1.5.0

The main documentation is hosted at https://github.com/starlys/RetroDRY#readme

Please note that this template compiles but does not do anything. You need to look for all the "//TODO" comments and complete
the development.
